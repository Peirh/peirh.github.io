There are some parallels Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters, as the two scripts happen to encode meaning in similar ways:

"old": Both 𓀗 and 老 depict an old person leaning on a walking stick.
"to give birth": Both 𓁒 and 育 show a child underneath a woman.

And many pictograms:
"eye": 𓁹 目
"mouth": 𓂋 口
"sun": 𓇳 日
"moon": 𓇹 月

Sometimes the meanings are slightly different:
"water" 𓈗 - "river" 川
"mountain" 𓈋 - "hill" 丘 (𓈉 would matche 山, but the former means "foreign land" not "mountain")
