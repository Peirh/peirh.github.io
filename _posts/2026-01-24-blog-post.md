There are many nice parallels Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters, as the two scripts happen to encode meaning in similar ways. Of course, the 'modern' Chinese character has become less pictographic and and we need to look at its form in the Oracle Bone Script.

"old": Both 𓀗 and ![Pic 1](images/lao-oracle.svg.png)老 depict an old person leaning on a walking stick.

"to give birth": Both 𓁒 and 育 show a child underneath a woman.

And many pictograms:

"eye": 𓁹 目

"mouth": 𓂋 口

"sun": 𓇳 日

"moon": 𓇹 月

Sometimes the meanings are slightly different:

"water" 𓈗 - "river" 川

"mountain" 𓈋 - "hill" 丘 (𓈉 would matche 山, but the former means "foreign land" not "mountain")
