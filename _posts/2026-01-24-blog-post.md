There are many nice parallels between Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters, although the 'modern' Chinese character has become less pictographic and we need to look at its form in the Oracle Bone Script.

"old": Both 𓀗 and 老(<img src="/images/lao-oracle.svg.png" alt="Lao Oracle" style="max-width: 5%; height: auto;" />)
 depict an old person leaning on a walking stick.

"to give birth": Both 𓁒 and 育(<img src="/images/yu-oracle.svg.png" alt="Yu Oracle" style="max-width: 5%; height: auto;" />) show a child underneath a woman.

And many pictograms:

"eye": 𓁹 目

"mouth": 𓂋 口

"sun": 𓇳 日

"moon": 𓇹 月

Sometimes the meanings are slightly different:

"water" 𓈗 - "river" 川

"mountain" 𓈋 - "hill" 丘(<img src="/images/qiu-oracle.svg.png" alt="Qiu Oracle" style="max-width: 5%; height: auto;" />) (𓈉 would match 山, but the former actually means "foreign land" not "mountain")
